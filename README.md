# Perceptron
Graphical Implementations of the Perceptron and Pocket Perceptron Algorithms in Matlab

I created three simple live graphical implementations of the Perceptron algorithm and Gallant's Pocket Perceptron algorithm using Matlab as part of my learning experience for the course of Computational Intelligence at DIT.UOI.

Supervising professor: Stavros P. Adam

## 1. The Implementations

* [Perceptron.m](/Perceptron.m) : The Perceptron Algorithm (Supervised) with sign activation function.
* [PerceptronEuclidean.m](/PerceptronEuclidean.m) : The Perceptron Algorithm (Supervised) with Euclidean distance termination and sign activation function.
* [PerceptronPocket.m](/PerceptronPocket.m) : The Pocket Perceptron Algorithm (Supervised) with sign activation function based on the pocket algorithm by Gallant.
